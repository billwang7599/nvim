# Neovim Setup

What I use as my "IDE". This uses Pvim for managing the environement which is built ontop on Neovim, and Lazy as a package manager. This also includes a [file tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) which uses the included nerd font.
Include the follow in ```.bashrc``` file.
```shell
PATH="$(pwd)/pvim:$PATH"
```
